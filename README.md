# TestCOM project
This project was created as a demonstration of the build process failing in ProjectExplorer

In the Resource folder is a shortcut for starting VFP 9 and VFP 10.
The shortcut "Start in" folder is set to c:\test\testcom
If you clone this project to a different location, these will need to be updated.

You'll need to restore the binary project file with "FoxBin2Prg".
Be sure to start VFP with administrative privileges to be able to build.
